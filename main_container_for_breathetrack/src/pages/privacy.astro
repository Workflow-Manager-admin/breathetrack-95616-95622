        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures.

          your operating system and browsers updated.

          your BOLT test history at any time using the "Clear History" function in the App. You can also clear all App 
          data by clearing your browser's local storage or uninstalling the App.
